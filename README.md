# An-Image-Processing-Approach-for-Analyzing-Assessment-of-Pavement-Distres
A state-of-the-art technique for finding and classifying pavement distress on road which makes use of a deep neural network technique called as convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the given images of distress into their different categories by making use of different “activation functions” to proclaim distinct identification of likely features by selecting the features automatically. A comparative result is given for three activation functions, viz. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Sigmoid, and Tanh.

The implementation of this work is done in Python language using Anaconda and Spyder.

Steps to run:

Step 1: Open Anaconda Prompt. Step 2: Type 'spyder' and hit enter. Step 3: Spyder is ready to run the python programs.

List of programs to run in below mentioned order:

1. img_aug.py: used to augment the original images.
2. cnn_pot.py: main program
3. pred_new_img.py: Pass an input image to this program and it will predict the type of pavement distress.

The output image attached shows only major output tables.
